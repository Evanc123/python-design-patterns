in python probably just use dependency injection. here is GPT:

In Python, singletons are often considered an anti-pattern, but there are specific scenarios where using a singleton could be justified:

1. **Global State Management**: If you have a single resource such as a configuration manager that needs to be shared and ensure state consistency, a singleton could be appropriate.

2. **Resource Pooling**: Database connections or thread pools are sometimes managed as singletons to centrally control resources.

3. **Logger**: A logging utility often runs as a singleton to ensure a single stream of logged data.

4. **Caching**: To maintain a single cache across multiple instances.

However, singletons have several downsides:

1. **Global State**: They make unit testing difficult because you can't isolate instances from each other.

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: They defy object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

3. **Tight Coupling**: Encourages tightly-coupled code which is harder to maintain and scale.

Alternatives to consider:

1. **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies explicitly instead of using global instances.

2. **Module-level Variables**: Python modules are singletons in their own right. You can define a state at the module level.

3. **Borg Pattern**: Shared state among instances without enforcing a single instance.

Whether you should use a singleton in Python largely depends on your specific requirements. However, often the need for a singleton suggests a possible design flaw and alternative patterns might be more appropriate.
